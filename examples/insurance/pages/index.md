# Welcome to SunnyDay Insurance's EventCatalog!

At **SunnyDay Insurance**, we’re committed to building a reliable and resilient digital ecosystem that meets the evolving needs of our customers. Our event-driven architecture is at the heart of this mission, enabling us to deliver responsive, scalable, and robust services.

**EventCatalog** is our comprehensive platform for discovering, exploring, and documenting the event-driven architecture that powers SunnyDay Insurance. Whether you're a developer, architect, or product owner, this page will guide you through the core components of our system, helping you understand how our services interact and evolve.

## Why Event-Driven Architecture?

An event-driven architecture allows us to build systems that are:

- **Responsive:** Our services react in real-time to the events that matter, ensuring timely and relevant actions for our customers.
- **Scalable:** We can easily scale individual components to meet demand, optimizing performance and resource usage.
- **Flexible:** By decoupling services, we enable independent evolution, reducing interdependencies and allowing for rapid innovation.
